1,433954215501635584,Thu Feb 13 13:22:02 +0000 2014,0,1,RapidCoin is up 100% since the time of my last post. CoinMarket.io if you want  in on the action. Cheapest coin on CoinMarketCap still!
2,433940456053817344,Thu Feb 13 12:27:21 +0000 2014,0,1,RapidCoin on CoinMarket.io is a great buy. Just look at it's market cap... Should be very easy to triple your money on this one.

6,431389282431803392,Thu Feb 06 11:29:54 +0000 2014,1,1,Starcoin (STR) looks like a nice coin to buy at the 255 satoshi it is going for at present. (this is not a pump - just an observation)

8,429494854985318400,Sat Feb 01 06:02:07 +0000 2014,0,2,I would recommend staying away from Neocoin or dumping it now...
9,429481893088591872,Sat Feb 01 05:10:37 +0000 2014,1,2,"Ironically enough, most coins that make for good pump and dumps make for bad long term investments."
10,429481578146709504,Sat Feb 01 05:09:22 +0000 2014,0,0,Long term investment in an altcoin ? Choose one that offers a low $ value block reward. Otherwise CoinChoose will rape your investment.
11,429478984535912449,Sat Feb 01 04:59:03 +0000 2014,0,1,Getting caught on the wrong end of altcoin pump and dumps? Limit your losses by not buying in when the price has recently inflated greatly.
12,429478535028150273,Sat Feb 01 04:57:16 +0000 2014,0,0,"FACT: It's much easier to dump 1 BTC worth of an altcoin than 100 BTC worth of an altcoin. If you're new, invest small amounts."
13,429478132651810816,Sat Feb 01 04:55:40 +0000 2014,0,0,What I meant with my last tweet is that you don't have to invest huge amounts to reap large rewards long term. Invest smart.
14,429477908160061440,Sat Feb 01 04:54:47 +0000 2014,0,0,FACT: It only takes a 1 BTC investment to see a 1 BTC profit when an altcoin rises 100%. And 1 BTC per day is 365 BTC per year = $292k+ USD.
15,429476577185763329,Sat Feb 01 04:49:29 +0000 2014,0,0,I personally only buy into coins with market caps below 300k. It limits the size of losses which can be quite high on coins with 1MM+ caps.
16,429475276645351424,Sat Feb 01 04:44:19 +0000 2014,0,0,It's a real shame BitcoinTalk got rid of the Altcoin Giveaway section. DOGE investors exploited that feature for maximum investment gain.
17,429474643271876608,Sat Feb 01 04:41:48 +0000 2014,0,0,I really don't think now is a good time to be shorting Bitcoin but that doesn't seem to be stopping some people from doing it...
18,429469733226700800,Sat Feb 01 04:22:18 +0000 2014,0,1,February 1st... Know what that means? It means nothing has changed in China just as nothing has since December 5th in the bitcoin world.
19,429466937316241408,Sat Feb 01 04:11:11 +0000 2014,0,0,"Betacoin, Galaxycoin, Krugercoin, Americancoin, Luckycoin, Argentum, etc. Know what they all had in common? Very low market caps pre-pump."
