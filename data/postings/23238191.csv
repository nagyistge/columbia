2,584085021562167296,Fri Apr 03 20:08:15 +0000 2015,0,0,@JetBlue the right response from your flight attendant would have been sure the seat is empty. Move and be comfortable. Not you need to pay
3,584083980837900289,Fri Apr 03 20:04:07 +0000 2015,0,0,@JetBlue I would have taken any open seat. The only open one was more room. I was not looking for a freebie just a peaceful trip.
4,584083263762919424,Fri Apr 03 20:01:16 +0000 2015,0,0,Jet blue would rather fly with an open seat then have a happy customer. I was not asking for anything outrageous.
