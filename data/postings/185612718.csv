182,585682129591341056,Wed Apr 08 05:54:35 +0000 2015,0,0,@misovski Wasn't intending to actually implement that. Just wondering what any SAPGUI would look like within the Launchpad.
183,585671591251599361,Wed Apr 08 05:12:43 +0000 2015,1,3,"When #SAP users need to fallback to SAPGUI, wonder if they would prefer to invoke it natively, or launch HTML edition from Fiori Launchpad?"
184,585670996822253569,Wed Apr 08 05:10:21 +0000 2015,9,6,This is SAPGUI (for HTML) launched within #Fiori Launchpad. Why? Because SAP support this scenario. http://t.co/daBh8D5TKB
185,585384750577094657,Tue Apr 07 10:12:55 +0000 2015,0,0,@tobiashofmann Not too shabby. So is that your preferred deployment approach for the Fiori launchpad?
186,585341746160111618,Tue Apr 07 07:22:02 +0000 2015,0,0,"@js1972 That being the case, I wonder how many customers are deploying it that way?"
187,585329038207557632,Tue Apr 07 06:31:32 +0000 2015,0,1,Wonder what the browser load time is for #SAP #Fiori Launchpad embedded in SAP Portal. Because you're kinda loading a portal in a portal.
188,583439305101578240,Thu Apr 02 01:22:24 +0000 2015,0,2,These native enterprise apps by Apple+IBM look very slick http://t.co/zKv3yhXZ8R IBM favoring native development over HTML5 it seems.
189,583432646522376192,Thu Apr 02 00:55:57 +0000 2015,0,2,Still perplexes me that SAP production systems need to be shutdown for daylight savings time shifts.  Wonder how cloud systems handle it?
190,583411972193951744,Wed Apr 01 23:33:48 +0000 2015,0,2,Mobility and Technology Presales role advertised by SAP in Melbourne if anyone is interested https://t.co/hiCoLXrH28
191,583204431107264512,Wed Apr 01 09:49:06 +0000 2015,0,0,@steverumsby @tpowlas I thought that Logistics was coming soon. Perhaps that might be announced at SAPPHIRE.
192,583202340745846784,Wed Apr 01 09:40:48 +0000 2015,0,0,"@steverumsby BTW, looking forward to meeting you in Melbourne for #masteringsap and picking your brain about Personas."
193,583200903332651009,Wed Apr 01 09:35:05 +0000 2015,0,1,"@steverumsby @Mark_Chalfen Yeah, definitely agree with that. Just trying to reconcile marketing messages with reality."
194,583200263944560640,Wed Apr 01 09:32:32 +0000 2015,0,0,@steverumsby @Mark_Chalfen But what about a greenfield implementation? If they still need SAPGUI for end users then solution is incomplete.
195,583199891867893760,Wed Apr 01 09:31:04 +0000 2015,0,0,@steverumsby @Mark_Chalfen But we've been there before with WDA/FPM.   Lack of uptake because developers could stick with legacy Dynpro.
196,583197855394885632,Wed Apr 01 09:22:58 +0000 2015,0,0,@steverumsby @Mark_Chalfen My fear is consultants advising to stay with SAPGUI simply because that's what they know. Then it will never die.
197,583188575371468800,Wed Apr 01 08:46:06 +0000 2015,0,1,@Mark_Chalfen @steverumsby I don't think it's a good thing if users can still access SAPGUI with S4HANA. It promotes inertia.
198,583072040241926144,Wed Apr 01 01:03:02 +0000 2015,0,0,"@greg_not_so OK so if we only define it by S/4HANA functions, then that applies. But end user might still be using SAPGUI for other stuff?"
199,583071162613125120,Wed Apr 01 00:59:32 +0000 2015,0,3,I just hope the S/4HANA is 'Completely Fiori' path doesn't follow the same timeline as the 'All SAP UIs are to be in Java' from @sagassi
