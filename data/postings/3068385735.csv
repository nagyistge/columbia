11,576175058848235521,Fri Mar 13 00:16:53 +0000 2015,0,0,@IamAdamJowett Adam agreed. It takes a strategic approach to see the truth in the numbers.
12,576174403928657920,Fri Mar 13 00:14:17 +0000 2015,0,2,@kavitharia Thanks Kavit. It's crazy how many #entrepreneurs blindly spend a fortune on marketing they can't track. Make marketing pay.
13,576157807432626176,Thu Mar 12 23:08:20 +0000 2015,1,0,Every $ spent on marketing should be 100% accountable. Marketing should never be an expense. Ditch anything that doesn't give a clear ROI.
14,576154313766146048,Thu Mar 12 22:54:27 +0000 2015,0,0,@IamAdamJowett Nice to connect Adam. Yes price bumps give incremental revenue. Which is all profit since overhead and COS are already paid.

18,575770008988557315,Wed Mar 11 21:27:22 +0000 2015,1,1,@AustinBristow differentiation is key. Even commodity items can be packaged with superior value prop. What can you offer that others can't?
19,575749651837632512,Wed Mar 11 20:06:28 +0000 2015,2,1,One of the easiest ways to grow ANY business is to increase your prices. Often a modest 20% jump in price can lead to a doubling of profits.
