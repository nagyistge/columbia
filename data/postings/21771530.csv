149,636959242692526080,Thu Aug 27 17:51:32 +0000 2015,0,0,@robefc1878 unfortunately that doesn't stop a club bidding for a player again. That's not being clueless just stating a fact
150,636958728026234880,Thu Aug 27 17:49:29 +0000 2015,0,1,@connjam surely that comes under what I said....they have a decision to make...do they give up as it go again. That's not bias

156,636955247345274880,Thu Aug 27 17:35:39 +0000 2015,0,0,@connjam if Chelsea do bid again it is a test of Everton's resolve there's nothing untoward implied in saying that
157,636954876904407040,Thu Aug 27 17:34:11 +0000 2015,0,0,@connjam it's not doing Everton down its stating that Everton have no control over what Chelsea decide to do next. 1/2
158,636954426004144132,Thu Aug 27 17:32:23 +0000 2015,0,0,@Rochey_efc and if chelsea do bid again then it is another test of their resolve like it or not 2/2

161,636952137080172544,Thu Aug 27 17:23:18 +0000 2015,0,1,@connjam because they still have a decision to make. Do they decide to try again anyway or do they give up. Nothing more nothing less

170,634734778361757697,Fri Aug 21 14:32:18 +0000 2015,0,0,@Jaap6Stam still makes sense to check...look how Rooney's contract situation turned round in the past. De Gea could have had a chat 1/2
