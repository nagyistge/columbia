195,601747454371966976,Fri May 22 13:52:27 +0000 2015,0,1,@EestiGirl1 lol. Most useful sort definitely. Who uses complicated maths in real life?! Well physics professors maybe. But nobody else :-)
196,601746908097486849,Fri May 22 13:50:17 +0000 2015,0,3,@EestiGirl1 yeah. Sort of an Eco friendly superhero! Definitely the future for crime fighting. I do like green too. Very restful :-))
